# What is a DNS block?

A DNS block is a mechanism that allows you to prevent access to certain web pages on the server. The technology was originally designed to help defend against spam and phishing attacks by blocking known suspicious IP addresses. Today, it serves a variety of purposes—some people use it as an antipiracy safeguard, while others use it to prevent access to infected or addictive sites (like gambling) in the workplace.<br>

The basic function of DNS blocking software is simple—it serves as a gateway between the web server and your personal server, ensuring your browser doesn’t recognize the blocked IP address and cannot access the website’s server.

the Social block list is for my personal use only, you can use that if you wish but i have custom tailored it for my blocking requirements and may contain some hosts that dont fall under social category
